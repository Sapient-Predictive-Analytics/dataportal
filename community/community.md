## Cross-DEX Native Token Trading Communities
Most Cardano DEXes are organized as DAOs where native tokens held my members have significant influence of the protocol and sometimes share in the distribution or deployment of profits. This fosters vibrant, decentralized communities that have a vested interest in the integrity and liquidity of their trading venue and broadens the base of token holders to long-term, small and diverse participants as opposed to founder, venture capital or whale holders. While not perfect yet, with some fairly dismal returns of most tokens since launch, this is a community-first, permissionless and mostly trustless process that deserves all our support and appreciation. A few problems of the current structure are obvious and have been addressed or are evolving with the broader ecosystem:

* Utility needs to be concrete and valuable. For the purpose of tax efficiency or to avoid classification as "securities" many native tokens are purely "utility" or "governance" in nature and the perks are oftensymbolic instead of monetizable. Similar to investment in traditional stocks' participation on voting rights and dividends, benefits needs to be clear and possess real value. Also, DAO decisions should not depend on foundation, reserve or team token holders to be able to make decisions.
  
* Supply should not overwhelm demand: when team or investors are remunerated in protocol tokens, instead of earmarked funds or other equity, the selling pressure during periods of low token value may overwhelm buying demand and create sustained bear market from which it is hard to recover.

* Dedicated smart contracts to sweep oversupply or sell into "pumps" are a good idea, if the mechanics are transparent but do not open free lunches to arbitrage bots or malificious actors. Technical solutions to increase liquidity and reduce volatility are hard, but one important area where DeFi needs to outperform TradFi.

At the time of writing, there are a lot of trading venues from large to tiny, highly specialized ones. To our best knowledge, the majority of Cardano native token liquidity in utility and governance tokens is carried out on the following trading venues:
