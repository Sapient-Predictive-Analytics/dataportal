# Utility of this project and some notes on stack choices

Recap of the Catalyst mission: Cardano native token data in ADA is unreliable and not usable for either trading or risk management. This severely limits DeFi and token funding. There are some good APIs for DEX users and paying professional users, but freely available data APIs and histroical data is limited to very poor often USD denominated token data. The open source community around trading and investment is familiar with Python (and to a lesser extend R and Matlab) tools and free or low cost data APIs or at least static historical data such as coinmarketcap and nasdaq/quandl. Most people are familiar with Pandas, for example reading CSV files and conveniently slicing, charting and backtesting their trading ideas.
