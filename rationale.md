## Choice of Most Popular Tokens for our Project
The investable universe of Cardano native tokens is growing rapidly, testament to the health of the ecosystem and the benefits of this novel way of raising funds. From initial airdrops to the community and free additional staking rewards, large scale Token Generation Events, ISPOs and Liquidity Bootstrapping are catching on, allowing more and more projects on Cardano to get interest for their governance or utility tokens.

To pick the first ten tokens to showcase and provide data for has not been easy. Some tokens have created a lot of value for their early holders and others have not. Some have large implied (fully diluted) market capitalization but trade small volume. To come up with a fair metric to pick our “launch 10” we used the following criteria:

1) Rank top 40 fully diluted market cap according to pool.pm and score first 40 points and 40th 1 point.
2) Rank top 40 by float / tokens available for trade and score first 40 points and 40th 1 point.
3) Rank top 40 by trading volume on Minswap on two separate 24 hour periods in March and April 2024 (5th and 10th respectively) and score first 40 points and 40th 1 point for a maximum of 80 points.
4) Eliminate tokens with less than 1 year trading history. Although some very interesting projects like AXO and FLDT are excluded this way, it limits the suitability for backtesting and we will add these tokens in the future with sufficient trading history.
5) We added two “bonus tokens” for a total of 12 to include Genius Yield (ticker:GENS) who have helped us a lot, and NEWM (ticker:NEWM) which was considered one of the top native tokens to be listed on Norwegian Block Exchange [NBX](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/112966) but did otherwise not make the cut in terms of market capitalization. We may voluntarily add more tokens that show certain merit or support us during this project.

We picked World Mobile Token, ranked #2, as the first actively traded token to publish a case study and data for during the development stages of this project as unlike AGIX its Token Paper is clear about the commitment to its Cardano native token as the main and currently only token standard.
