# API Infrastructure Considerations

This suggested technology stack focuses on simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and minimal dependencies, using primarily open-source tools.

## Web Framework: Flask

    * Why Flask? Flask is a lightweight Python web framework that's easy to get started with and highly flexible for developing REST APIs. It is minimalistic by design, which helps in maintaining fewer dependencies.
    * Key Libraries: Flask-RESTful for simplifying API creation and Flask-SQLAlchemy for ORM support.

## Database: SQLite

    * Why SQLite? SQLite is a lightweight, file-based database that does not require a separate server process. It’s suitable for smaller datasets and development environments, making it ideal for a low-cost, low-maintenance solution.
    * Alternatives: For future scalability or to handle concurrent accesses, PostgreSQL is another open source solution offering more robust features.

## API Hosting: AWS Elastic Beanstalk

    * Why AWS Elastic Beanstalk? Elastic Beanstalk is an easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications and services. It supports Python and Flask directly and can scale automatically based on traffic. The AWS Free Tier includes Elastic Beanstalk, making it cost-effective for small projects.
    * Setup: We can package the Flask application and deploy it directly on Elastic Beanstalk. AWS handles load balancing, application health monitoring, and auto-scaling.

## Data Source

    * Data Handling: To fetch and handle Cardano token data, we can use libraries like ccxt which provides a way to interface with a variety of cryptocurrency exchanges.
    * Data Storage: Regularly fetch and store historical data in our SQLite/PostgreSQL database for backtesting purposes.

## Authentication & Security

    * Simple Auth: Flask's extensions like Flask-HTTPAuth to add basic authentication to our API.
    * SSL/TLS: Ensure that our API is served over HTTPS. AWS’s Certificate Manager for managing SSL/TLS certificates or Let’s Encrypt for a free certificate.

## API Documentation and Versioning

    * Documentation: tools like Swagger (with Flask-RESTPlus) or flask-apispec for API documentation. These tools provide interactive documentation that’s useful for developers.
    * Versioning: Implement API versioning from the start (e.g., /api/v1/endpoint) to avoid future compatibility issues as our API evolves.

## Monitoring and Logging
    * Monitoring: Elastic Beanstalk provides basic monitoring capabilities, alternatively integrate with AWS CloudWatch for more detailed insights.
    * Logging: Python’s built-in logging module to log API usage and errors, which can be reviewed via Elastic Beanstalk’s log files.

## Example Project Structure

~~~~
/cardano_api
|-- app.py                # Main Flask application
|-- requirements.txt      # Python dependencies
|-- /api
    |-- __init__.py
    |-- models.py         # Database models
    |-- routes.py         # API routes
|-- /tests
    |-- test_api.py       # API unit tests
~~~~

## Deployment Steps

    1. Develop the Flask app locally.
    2. Test the API thoroughly.
    3. Deploy on AWS Elastic Beanstalk using the EB CLI or directly through the AWS Management Console.
    4. Monitor and scale as needed based on usage patterns.

This stack and approach ensure that we can start small and scale as needed, using open-source tools that are broadly supported and well-documented.
