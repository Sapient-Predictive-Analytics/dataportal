## Data vs Clean Data: How to Screen, Transform, Merge or Reshape Raw Token Time Series Data

Most of the time, we receive time series data from a DEX's API, some aggregator source or download it directly from someone else. It is highly unlikely that this data represents the reality of what actually can be achieved in the market at any point in time. From obvious "fat finger" errors like 9.1112 instead of 0.1112 as the token's high price, the opening could be identical to the previous' day's close because the market "never closes" and timezones or trading hours are not established in crypto markets. Also, the low could be achieved by a cascading AMM fill for stop loss orders being triggered where the final order to execute is for a few hundred ADA at a price that is close to zero. Data manipulation or data connectivity problems during the API call could be other sources or wrong or mangled data. Ideally, we want to run a few scripts over our time series to find the most harmful errors that could badly skew our trading strategy analysis, or lead to wrong risk measurements.
